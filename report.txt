Once you have implemented both approaches, compare the results in terms of 
    reliability, 
    fault tolerance, 
    correctness
Include in your submission a short report considering at least the following situations:
    A tuplespace goes down
    An adapter goes down

First Approach:
    reliability - the first approach is reliable in the sense that it will record all events and replay them
    fault tolerance - the first approach is not very fault tolerant because there is a lot of moving parts
    correctness - the first approach is correct as long as you don't use spaces in your topic or messages

    Scenario
        A tuplespace goes down - if the tuplespace goes down.  The recovery will record all of the actions.
        An adapter goes down - if the adapter is down, the recovery will record all of the events.

        when tuplespace comes up, the recovery will replay the events

Second Approach:
    reliability - 
    fault tolerance - 
    correctness - 

    Scenario
        A tuplespace goes down
        An adapter goes down
